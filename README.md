# App Title and Description:

### GMRD is an app where you and your friends can create lists of games. Users are able to edit and remove games from their lists as well as view other lists. Letterboxd is a site where users can create a list of their favourite movies. We wanted to create an app that replicates this idea but for gaming.
### The GMRD app was created and designed by: Nicole Chan, Michael Lucky and Folu Tokode.
